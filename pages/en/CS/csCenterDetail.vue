              Greetings. This is the Handsome.com.<br />
              We apologize for the inconvenience as the connection to our customer center is being delayed due to a large amount of inquiries made to the Handsome.com.<br /><br />
              Currently, it is difficult for us to give you a response in real time. So if you can make an inquiry to [1:1 Query] in My Page, we will assist you as soon as possible.<br />
              Since phone connection is difficult, if you can prepare the details of [1:1 Query], we will check the details of your inquiry and reply as soon as possible.<br />
              â€» Honeytalk chatting consultation is temporarily suspended until the customer center is stabilized<br /><br />
              We sincerely apologize once again for the inconvenience.<br />
              We will do our best to quickly normalize the customer center.<br /><br />
              Thank you.
